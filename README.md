# Module 6 Challenge
## Problem
In this problem, we were required to use Weather api in python and get the weather data. We were then required to use this data to visialize weather in Northern and Southern hemisphere regions pf earth. As part of another problem, we were required to get hotels for vacation in the cities that match our weather criterias.

## Location of source
* **Code** :
  * starter_code/WeatherPy.ipynb
  * starter_code/VacationPy.ipynb
* **Output Data** :
  * starter_code/output_data/Fig1.png,
  * starter_code/output_data/Fig2.png,
  * starter_code/output_data/Fig3.png,
  * starter_code/output_data/Fig4.png,
  * starter_code/output_data/cities.csv 

## Learnings
* We learnt to use api in python, pass api keys and other request params and get the data from remote server.
* We learnt to store this data in the CSV file
* We learnt to create and use functions to do operations that are repeatable.
* We learnt to use linear regession and use rvalue to derive correlation between latitude and different weather aspects.
* We learnt how to use the weather and geo data to find vactions destinations based on personal preferences.
* We learnt to use hvplot functions and its parameters.
